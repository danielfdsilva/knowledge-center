# Reduxeed

The `reduxeed.js` exports a series of functions that make creating redux reducers for api responses a breeze. That being said there are some assumption being made.

Jump to the end for [recipes](#recipes).

The following guide will explain those assumptions and how they came to be.

Three different actions get defined for each api reducer:
  - `REQUEST_<EXAMPLE>`
  - `RECEIVE_<EXAMPLE>`
  - `INVALIDATE_<EXAMPLE>`

The `REQUEST_<EXAMPLE>` gets called as soon as the request start, and will be used to signal the state that the request has started.
The `RECEIVE_<EXAMPLE>` is called when the api request finishes. It will be celled with an error if anything went wrong with the api.
The `INVALIDATE_<EXAMPLE>` action is used to reset the state to its original state.

With each of these actions comes an action creator:
```js
  function invalidateExample () {
    return { type: INVALIDATE_EXAMPLE };
  }

  function requestExample () {
    return { type: REQUEST_EXAMPLE };
  }

  function receiveExample (data, error = null) {
    return {
      type: RECEIVE_EXAMPLE,
      data,
      error,
      receivedAt: Date.now()
    };
  }
```

To avoid always creating those functions we have a helper function `makeActions` which takes the action name as a parameter and whether we want "key actions" or not. The concept of "key actions" is expanded later.

The above would be recreated as:
```js
  const {
    invalidate: invalidateExample,
    request: requestExample,
    receive: receiveExample
  } = makeActions('EXAMPLE');
```
After having the actions ready you need a reducer to intercept the actions.
If you were to create one from scratch for our example, it would look something like:

```js
  const initialState = {
    fetching: false,
    fetched: false,
    error: null,
    data: {}
  };

  function (state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INVALIDATE_EXAMPLE':
        return initialState;
      case 'REQUEST_EXAMPLE': {
        return {
          fetching: true,
          fetched: false,
          error: null,
          data: {}
        };
      }
      case 'RECEIVE_EXAMPLE': {
        return {
          fetching: false,
          fetched: true,
          receivedAt: action.receivedAt,
          data: action.data,
          error: action.error
        };
      }
    }
    return state;
  };
```

Each and every API state will have the following 5 properties:
  - fetching -> Tracks whether a request is in inflight
  - fetched -> Tracks whether a request was completed successfully or not.
  - error -> Tracks whether a request errored.
  - data -> Holds the data send by the request if it was successful.
  - receivedAt -> Timestamp of when the request finished.

To simplify the reducer creation we have a helper function `makeAPIReducer` which takes the action name as a parameter and whether we want "key actions" or not.

The above would be recreated as:

```js
  const reducer = makeAPIReducer('EXAMPLE');
```

Once we have the reducer, we can create the thunk that will make the api request.
The flow of the thunk is something like:
  - Indicate request is started
  - Make the request
  - Dispatch result.

Following our example, a thunk made from scratch would be:

```js
  function fetchExample () {
    return async function (dispatch) {
      dispatch(requestExample());
      try {
        const response = await fetch('http://example.com');
        const result = await response.json();
        return dispatch(receiveExample(result));
      } catch (error) {
        return dispatch(receiveExample(null, error));
      }
    };
  }
```

**NOTE:** This thunk assumes that the api response is in JSON format and so will our helper function `makeFetchThunk`.

The above is achieved with:
```js
  function fetchExample () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      requestFn: requestExample,
      receiveFn: receiveExample
    });
  }
```

However the `makeFetchThunk` helper provides much more functionalities.
You want to use a different method (POST for instance) with a body? You can just provide an `options` object, and it will be used by the `fetch` function.
```js
  function fetchExample () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      options: {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer the-bearer-token'
        },
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(query)
      },
      requestFn: requestExample,
      receiveFn: receiveExample
    });
  }
```

Feeling power user?
If the response from the api does not suit your needs immediately you can also change the response before it is dispatched.
```js
  function fetchExample () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      mutator: (body, headers) => {
        // In this case we're discarding the body completely and just returning
        // the headers. Unlikely use case, but hey, whatever float your goat.
        return headers;
      },
      requestFn: requestExample,
      receiveFn: receiveExample
    });
  }
```

This `makeFetchThunk` helper function also allows you to cache data so that following requests do not hit the network.
To use caching you need to set `cache: true` and provide the path to the app state where the data you're requesting would be stored.
Imagine the following store state:
```js
{
  general: {},
  posts: {}
  config: {
    global: {}
  }
}
```

We could argue that the the global config only needs to load once and then the cached version will do just fine.
```js
  function fetchGlobalConfig () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      cache: true,
      statePath: ['config', 'global'],
      requestFn: requestGlobalConfig,
      receiveFn: receiveGlobalConfig
    });
  }
```

Note that this will not store the data on the provided path. That's the reducer job, and you'll have to setup your state slices accordingly.
For example:

@redux/config.js
```js
  const {
    invalidate: invalidateGlobalConfig,
    request: requestGlobalConfig,
    receive: receiveGlobalConfig
  } = makeActions('GLOBAL_CONFIG');

  export function fetchGlobalConfig () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      cache: true,
      statePath: ['config', 'global'],
      requestFn: requestGlobalConfig,
      receiveFn: receiveGlobalConfig
    });
  }

  export default combineReducers({
    global: makeAPIReducer('GLOBAL_CONFIG')
  });
```

@redux/store.js
```js
  import configReducer from './config.js';

  export default combineReducers({
    config: configReducer
  });
```

### Key Actions
Key actions provide a way of fetching and storing different entries for the same data type.

Imagine we have a blog and we want to fetch individual blog posts.
The most common approach is to have a reducer and handle a single post at a time.
```
{
  post: // The post content
}
```
Every time we fetch a new post the previous one is gone. If the user goes back to it, a new request has to be made.
A better way of storing this would be to index the posts by their `id`. Something like:
```
{
  posts: {
    id1: // The post 1
    id2: // The post 2
  }
}
```

This is what "key actions" do. They store whatever piece of data they receive under a key. (in this case the id).
When creating the actions and the reducer they have to be made aware that a key is coming.
```js
  const {
    invalidate: invalidatePost,
    request: requestPost,
    receive: receivePost
    // The true flag indicates that these will be key actions.
  } = makeActions('POST', true);

  // The true flag tells the reducer to expect key actions.
  const reducer = makeAPIReducer('POST', true)

  export function fetchPost (key) {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      // The true power of key action comes when you cache the data.
      // In the blog post example, caching the data means that if the user goes
      // back to the same post the data is already available.
      cache: true,
      // Now instead of having a fixed state path, it will depend on the key
      // we decide to use.
      statePath: ['posts', key],
      // Once actions are defined as key actions, they will accept the key as
      // the first parameter, so we have to bind it to them before passing them
      // to our thunk.
      requestFn: requestPost.bind(null, key),
      receiveFn: receivePost.bind(null, key)
    });
  }
```

### Using the api response
All these examples help us understand how the reducers are setup and how the api data is stored in each state slice, but not how to use it.
We also have some helpers to work with the data produced by our `makeApiReducer` which, in its initial state, is:
```js
  {
    fetched: false,
    fetching: false,
    receivedAt: 0,
    data: {},
    error: null
  }
```

When getting this data from the state (in redux's connect function) we wrap it with `wrapApiResult`.
```js
function mapStateToProps (state) {
  return {
    globalConfig: wrapApiResult(state.config.global),
  };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, {})(Component);
```

This will gives us some helper functions:
 - raw(): returns the data as is.
 - isReady(): Whether or not the fetching finished and was fetched.
 - hasError(): Whether the request finished with an error.
 - getData(): Returns the data. If the data has a results list will return that
 - getMeta(): If there's a meta object in the response it will be returned

For example, to check whether the request has finished you can use:
```js
  globalConfig.isReady();
```
instead of doing
```js
  globalConfig.fetched && !globalConfig.fetching
```

A more complete example:
```js
const AppTitleComponent = ({ globalConfig }) => {
  const { isReady, hasError, getData } = globalConfig;
  if (isReady()) {
    return 'Loading';
  }
  if (hasError()) {
    return 'Ups';
  }

  return <h1>{getData().title}</h1>;
};
```

## Recipes

#### Simple reducer:
```js
  const {
    invalidate: invalidateExample,
    request: requestExample,
    receive: receiveExample
  } = makeActions('EXAMPLE');

  export function fetchExample () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      requestFn: requestExample,
      receiveFn: receiveExample
    });
  }

  export default makeAPIReducer('EXAMPLE');
```

#### List and Single cached
```js
  const {
    invalidate: invalidateList,
    request: requestList,
    receive: receiveList
  } = makeActions('LIST');

  export function fetchList () {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      cache: true,
      statePath: ['slice', 'list'],
      requestFn: requestList,
      receiveFn: receiveList
    });
  }

  const {
    invalidate: invalidateSingle,
    request: requestSingle,
    receive: receiveSingle
  } = makeActions('SINGLE', true);

  export function fetchSingle (key) {
    return makeFetchThunk({
      url: 'http://example.com',
      cache: true,
      statePath: ['slice', 'single', key],
      requestFn: requestSingle.bind(null, key),
      receiveFn: receiveSingle.bind(null, key)
    });
  }

  export default combineReducers({
    list: makeAPIReducer('LIST'),
    single: makeAPIReducer('SINGLE', true)
  });
```
